								<div class="ck">
								<p>Working as an experience strategist, I plan how sensory inputs and outputs can focus an experience and make something more meaningful, useful &nbsp;or interesting. To improve on this, but also for my own benefit, I practice awareness of my own senses and how, on their own or mediated with &nbsp;technologies, these senses shift or expand attention, affecting my state of mind and emotion. The work of planning, and the work of attentiveness &nbsp;have recently come into tension as the limits and pressures of the built sensory environment – home, an outside world, surrounding activity – push &nbsp;against psychological needs in a disorienting present. I’m less able to focus, but still trying to take it all in and what I receive is a mix of natural and &nbsp;artificial, each with their own agendas, benign or menacing. As I am alone, they sound and reverberate more strongly. &nbsp;</p>

								<p>For much of our life in architecture there has been a foreboding sense that money eclipses and precedes most experience. The sensory qualities &nbsp; of life that are vivid not only seem to be but are literally unanchored; routinely life splitting if you allow the physiology of sensory experience. Those &nbsp; that theorize the nervous system – such as art historian Jonathan Crary – convey mediated stimuli virtually autonomous of the socially fabricated &nbsp; meanings that are made concurrent to disguise the damage. A sensory person dismantled by stimuli – not fulfilled. All of this begins to fall apart, &nbsp; however, if you imagine a world a mere 20 years from now: people far from distant urban life, living in shelters that are a downstream by-product of &nbsp; solar energy. Rather than being subjects of a divided nervous system, urban media and capital, we imagine living aside near-automatic solar energy &nbsp; generation. A house that does not know you are home. The spectrum of light (and chemistry) at play does not register to the human eye. Leaving &nbsp; the would-be subject unknown in the solar nexus. Alone for the first time in two centuries: adjacent to the instrumental rather than within it. After architecture. After real estate. After scarcity. &nbsp;</p>

								<div class="ck">
								<p>In these strange times, sensing heat is used to control the movement of people. Mammals (and birds) evolved to maintain and regulate their body’s temperature in near optimal condition for biological processes. When something goes wrong, such as in the case of COVID-19, the body often responds &nbsp; by raising its temperature. This change in temperature is now used as part of the biopolitical theatre of control and containment, executed through &nbsp; our constructed technological heat measurement instrument – the thermometer. But the technology used to maintain and regulate temperature is the &nbsp; thermostat, invented in 1620 by Cornelis Drebbel to control the temperatures of the chicken incubator. The thermostat is considered to be the first (first order) cybernetic device, as it allows for feedback control. It is then not surprising that it was used to outsource the care for lifeforms to a “machine.” Our bodies are thus both sensor and regulator: thermometer (through thermoception) and thermostat.</p>

								<p>At this precarious point in history, we may be witnessing the twilight of individual human agency. As a culture, we have thrown ourselves into processes &nbsp; that generate complex fields of influence and control, emanating from computational, procedural, and organizational forms that exceed the boundaries &nbsp; of coherent human perception and cognition. These algorithmically driven creations have long since acquired metabolic patterns all their own and now&nbsp;orchestrate humans at scales both inconceivably vast and imperceptibly subtle toward goals almost unknowable in their systemic abstraction. In order to be able to remain a participant in our own unfolding future, humans as a species must strive to build tools that give us lenses onto facets of these systems in order to truly see dependencies and potentialities. Data visualization, simulation in game engines, public software stacks providing privacy and participatory models for collaborative governance; these are the core infrastructures of a new approach to socially-centered computation.</p>

								<p>Being away from my culture to get trained as a designer in another language offers me a new life and practice to build something both similar and &nbsp; strange. I started over as someone with an empty history who knows little about social norms. I am not more confident, not more ignorant, not freer, or &nbsp; braver. Life seems to hover between wet and dry, and I decide to focus on making sense of myself and the surroundings, in the hope of finding myself &nbsp; as a standard for reference. For my 4-year old past, everything I own, I remember how and why I attained them and the price I paid. I numbered all items &nbsp; with orders based on the most used to the least used as well as the time these occupied and the pleasure they gave. An abstract subject such as my &nbsp; life gets to be solidified by keeping a personal recording – an act of organizing the unorganized. &nbsp;</p>

								<div class="info">SENSING THE SOCIAL</div>
								<div class="ck">
								<p>Is there a sense of the social? An awareness of the presence or absence of one’s friends, acquaintances, family, of the wider circle of people one is &nbsp; affiliated with personally or professionally, of maybe the society one is part of? With the advent of social media messages, postings, log-ins and last &nbsp; online notifications have become the means by which we sense the social. An outstanding presence on a messenger, a lack of posting on a social &nbsp; media platform or the simple absence of likes on postings. The machines that enable such social senses constantly sense and order our social &nbsp; interactions themselves. Each individual is a node on a graph, each interaction an edge between nodes. Centrality measures immediately calculate &nbsp; the relative distance and importance of any given node, and enable strategies to suggest contacts, contexts and ads. The order of our sense of the social &nbsp; is thus generated at the intersection of economic, political and machinic dynamics. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:0.9em;">Experimental setup developed at the MIT Group Research Laboratory during the late 1940’s which gave rise to the development of centrality measures. The setup &nbsp;consists of a round table sitting five participants separated by screens. Tasked to order a set of cards they were only allowed to communicate via leaflets &nbsp;passed through slits in the screens. Once order had been established the participants could click a switch connected to a light panel in a different room. The epistemology of the social of this setup eventually lead to social media like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram &amp; TikTok.</span></p>

Due to the mutual overlap and non-obvious connections, the composition resembles colourful fields and plots seen from a bird`s eye view." src="./Responses - Sensory Orders_files/def1000_13_1.png"><img alt="A horizontal photo, depicting a tangle of metal elements which constitute a multi-layered construction. They are connected to each other at right angles, which gives the feeling of depth and multidimensionality. The photo is in white and grey tones, but yellow construction elements are also visible, which diversifies the composition and its colours. " src="./Responses - Sensory Orders_files/def1000_13_2.png"><img alt="A horizontal photo, showing shipping containers arranged in stacks. Stacking of the containers resulted in the creation of giant metal structures which give the picture rhythm and define three vertical, parallel axes, to the left, right, and in the centre of the photo. The containers are additionally covered with a green and red protective net. The photo is brightly lit and dominated by shades of green, red, and grey. The whole composition gives the impression of observing skyscrapers. " src="./Responses - Sensory Orders_files/def1000_13_3.png"><img alt="A horizontal graphic, displaying a digital representation of a transshipment terminal with a huge number of shipping containers arranged in stacks. The graphic is in light, grey-blue colours, but thanks to the use of orange elements resembling reinforcements or scaffolding, as well as black, rectangular patches on the ground, the image is multidimensional and dynamic.  " src="./Responses - Sensory Orders_files/def1000_13_4.png"><img alt="A horizontal, digital graphic, depicting an abstract form, resembling a fluid caught in the air. The entire object is built of smaller, aquamarine forms that are selectively cut. Thanks to this, you can see the other layers, arranged in circles: from the outer green, through yellow, to the inner red. The object is inside a white grid with numerical parameters, surrounded by black space. " src="./Responses - Sensory Orders_files/def1000_13_5.png"><img alt="A horizontal graphic with blue visualization on a black background. The depicted object is built of many blue and white lines, arranged symmetrically in two whirls – one in the upper left corner, and another in the opposite, lower right corner. Between them you can see patches of the black background on which the whirls are located." src="./Responses - Sensory Orders_files/def1000_13_6.png"><img alt="A horizontal digital image with a pattern of yellow, diagonal lines against a black background. They intersect each other at right angles, and at each joint there are amorphous purple, blue, and aquamarine objects. Their shapes seem to be oval, with their sides in constant rotational or translational motion. In addition, their surface is covered with a network of thin, light purple lines.

						<img alt="A horizontal photocopy with two black and white pamphlets lying parallel to each other. The pamphlet on the left shows a dark grey photo of a circular object on a black background. It takes up half of the pamphlet, and directly below the photo there is a description “stone = 071, in, jar * 016,” distributed over three lines. On the opposite side there is a second pamphlet, with a piece of text saying “life things. index” in the upper left corner. In the opposite corner, there are three large characters, probably from the Japanese katakana. They give the impression that they are &quot;pixelated&quot;.
